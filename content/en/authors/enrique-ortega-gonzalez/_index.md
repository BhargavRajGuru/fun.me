I have a Degree in Chemistry and I teach Physics and Chemistry at [IES José del Campo](http://www.josedelcampo.com) in Ampuero (Cantabria). Outside the academic sphere, I am secretary of the Cajiga de Laredo Hiking Club and member of the Board of Directors of the [Asociación de Amigos del Patrimonio de Laredo](https://amigospatrimoniolaredo.es).
