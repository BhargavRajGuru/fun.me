I am a strong advocate of games as a learning tool and it is the basis from which I put into practice different methodologies and teaching strategies, especially Game-Based Learning (GBL). I currently combine my teaching work with the design of educational board games, collaboration with different publishers and teacher training. And, of course, I share everything I prepare for my classes and try to learn from my colleagues through social networks. Oh!, and I also have a small [educational game design studio](https://www.aprendizajebasadoenjuegos.es/).
